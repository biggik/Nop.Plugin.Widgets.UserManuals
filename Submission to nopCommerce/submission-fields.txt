User Manuals

Short description:
Allows publishing user manuals on your website, optionally linked to your products

Description:
<p>This is a nopCommerce widget plugin for managing <strong>user manuals</strong> for displaying on your nopCommerce public site, optionally linked to products. 

    <p>The plugin can display in two widget zones, one for accessing the user manual list (available at /UserManuals), for example integrating with
        your menu system. The second widget zone is any of the ProductDetailXXX widget zones, where available manuals will be made accessible for the product being viewed.
    <br>The user manual list is ordered by active products (manuals linked to products that are active), and then by manuals either not with an active product
        or with an unpublished product.
    <br>Manuals can also be categorized by manufacturer as well as custom categories. 
    
    <p>The plugin behaves similarly to nopCommerce core plugins. It has Admin area menu entries for accessing the functionality, but if you are logged on and have the 
        appropriate ACL rights to manage user manuals you'll also have a <strong>Manage this page</strong> link in the administration header.
    <p>The plugin has it's own ACL right (ManageUserManuals) which need to be assigned to the appropriate customer role(s).
    
    <p>You can take a look at the <a href="https://demo.status.is" target="_blank">demo site</a> for an example or take a look at the source code on 
        <a href="https://github.com/biggik/Nop.Plugin.Widgets.UserManuals" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 
    
    <p>This is a completely free plugin, so any requested support or change requests will be managed accordingly. However, the plugin is live on an actual site and will be maintained.</p>
